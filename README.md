## About

This repository showcases a desktop tool made for the purpose of creating (mass) accounts for various websites in a swift and easy manner. In order to do so, multiple factors need to be circumvented:

- Captcha (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha)
- SMS Verification
- Email Verification
- IP-Based Rate Limit

Using third-party services, IMAP protocol, and proxies, we are able to get around these protections such that our interaction with APIs seem as human as possible.

## Note

The code in this repository is almost two years old, me and Cam have significantly bettered our coding practices since then ðŸ˜„. Additionally, some of the modules may or may not work as these websites change often.
